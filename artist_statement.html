                <h3>Digital Media Artist</h2>
                <br>
                    I’ve primarily worked with drawing and illustrations with a different approach to the creation of art. More specifically, illustration for the means of storytelling, however within these works art work should be viewed with a different perspective and definition. The essence of being an artist is expressing your view for others to see. Being an artist means creating pieces of art that inspire others to take action, discuss, and deliberate with one another. That is what I feel separates an artist from an illustrator. A primary motive behind my artwork is to tell a story and connect with my audience through my pieces of artwork. Outside of creation for aesthetics, I hope to spark people’s imagination and alter their perspective of the world through the lens of my art pieces.

                    My body of work focuses on form, content, and technique. In my opinion, art is often mistaken as something an individual looks at, however, the contents of the work vary due to the audiences’ different perspectives and reactions to a piece. Some will look at a piece for its narrative content while others will view it through a more critical lens. Artwork is a framework that allows individuals to creatively express a theme or purpose to a more vast audience. I enjoy creating works of art that are self-interpretable for the audience. By doing so, I’m able to engage in my audiences’ interpretations not by simply stating what is occurring, but rather by undermining narratives and hiding material for them to be found by those viewing and pieced together.

                    I’m currently exploring different mediums for the best way to articulate my ideas. My projects do not focus on one medium as mixed media allows me to express different ideas more effectively. Within my work I utilized different mediums such as data bending (glitch art), 3D modeling, coded art, and website construction, however, I’ve utilized different programs ranging from the Adobe Suite to illustration programs such as Clip Studio Paint to create an array of experiences. Creating work through video, coding, illustration, and 3D allowed me to express my thoughts and ideas in sophisticated ways. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    I was able to produce a distinctive visual representation of my ideas and imagination through these creations. Each work of art is unique, just like every viewer's reaction to it. My intention is to produce a work of art that will pique someone's interest and capture it until they can come up with their own interpretation and thoughtful reaction. If I am able to get a single viewer to stop, think, and reflect on the artwork I’ve created, then the objective of my work will be fulfilled.
